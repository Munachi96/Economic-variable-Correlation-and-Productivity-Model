Economic Variable Correlation and Productivity Model
Introduction

This report compares key economic indicators—M1 Money Supply, Stock Market Performance, and Inflation Rate—between the USA and Nigeria over several years.

Methodology

Data was sourced from reliable platforms and analyzed in Python. We used correlation analysis and visualizations to explore relationships between these indicators in both countries.

Key Findings

USA:

M1 vs. Inflation: Strong positive correlation (0.85), showing money supply significantly impacts inflation.
M1 vs. Stock Market: Moderate negative correlation (-0.31), indicating that more money supply might reduce market performance.
Stock Market vs. Inflation: Weak negative correlation (-0.31), suggesting slight market reduction with higher inflation.
Nigeria:

M1 vs. Inflation: Extremely strong positive correlation (0.98), indicating a direct link.
M1 vs. Stock Market: Strong positive correlation (0.60), showing that increased money supply boosts market performance.
Stock Market vs. Inflation: Moderate positive correlation (0.46), suggesting inflation could enhance market performance.
Productivity Model

Productivity was modeled as:𝑃=𝑀+𝑆−𝐼3P= 3M+S−I
​
 

Where P is productivity, M is money supply, S is stock market performance, and I is inflation. Trends were plotted over time, revealing:

Flat Productivity: Stability.
Decreasing Productivity: Inefficiencies due to inflation.
Increasing Productivity: Economic improvements.
Conclusion

The analysis highlights significant correlations, particularly in Nigeria, where inflation and currency devaluation pose major challenges. Careful monetary policy is crucial to maintaining economic stability.
