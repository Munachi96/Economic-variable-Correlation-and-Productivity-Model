# Economic Variable Correlation and Productivity Model
Introduction :
This report provides a comparative analysis of three key economic indicators: M1 Money Supply, Stock Market Performance, and Inflation Rate for the USA and Nigeria. The data spans several years and is visualized to understand the trends and draw insights.

## Methodology
Data was sourced from reliable platforms  (CBN, FRED, yahoo fin, ngxgroup.com) and analyzed in Python. We used correlation analysis and visualizations to explore relationships between these indicators in both countries.

## Key Findings
USA:
- M1 vs. Inflation : Strong positive correlation (0.85), showing money supply significantly impacts inflation.
- M1 vs. Stock Market : Moderate negative correlation (-0.31), indicating that more money supply might reduce market performance.
- Stock Market vs. Inflation : Weak negative correlation (-0.31), suggesting slight market reduction with higher inflation.
  
Nigeria:
- M1 vs. Inflation : Extremely strong positive correlation (0.98), indicating a direct link.
- M1 vs. Stock Market : Strong positive correlation (0.60), showing that increased money supply boosts market performance.
- Stock Market vs. Inflation : Moderate positive correlation (0.46), suggesting inflation could enhance market performance.

## Productivity Model
Productivity was modeled as:ùëÉ=ùëÄ+ùëÜ‚àí3 
Where P is productivity, M is money supply, S is stock market performance, and I is inflation. Trends were plotted over time, revealing:

Flat Productivity : Stability.<br>
Decreasing Productivity : Inefficiencies due to inflation.<br>
Increasing Productivity : Economic improvements.<br>

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights significant correlations, particularly in Nigeria, where inflation and currency devaluation pose major challenges. Careful monetary policy is crucial to maintaining economic stability. [FULL ANALYSIS REPORT HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oMQsU8UlKC5i03izxt8-v6UeeKLXEfO1J-XAq7PhCk8/edit)
